                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>My project mainly uses the combination of gesture recognition model and Arduino to create an interactive device. First of all, the movement of hands is also a way of self-expression, so I chose to use hands as the input form, and the audience can express their goodwill or malice through different gestures. After the camera captures the audience's gestures, different motors will be driven. Each motor has a different appearance and meaning, and has a different impact on the model in the middle. I hope that the audience can use this work to realize that it is not a small act of kindness, and it is not a small act of evil. Every good intention and malice you have will have an impact on others. It may be only subtle, but the cumulative effect is huge.</p>

                <h3>Concept and Background Research</h3>
                
                <p>Good and evil have always been in opposition to each other, and small acts of kindness and malice do not have much influence on others, so people often ignore these details. The inspiration of my work comes from a sentence "Don't do evil because it is small, don't do good when it is small". In today's rapidly developing society, the relationship between people is becoming weaker and weaker. People seem to care more about their own interests, thus ignoring the harm to those around them. Maybe a small thing you think will also hurt you. The people around cause fatal harm, so I want to create such an art work, so that the audience can see the influence of goodwill and malice on others, so as to spread more kindness to the people around them, and pay attention to every little detail of their behavior.</p>

                <h3>Technical Implementation</h3>
                <p>In terms of the input of the work, I chose gesture recognition, because I think hands are one of the important ways of expression in people's daily life. It may be a kind touch and caress, or a malicious collision or violence, all of which will have more or less influence on the people around us. Express your language through different gestures. </p>

                <p>In the middle, I hope to create a model that represents the public. I have tried many materials, such as clay, newspaper, acrylic, etc. Its surface is uneven, as if everyone has their own protective shell, and the two The two motors represent kindness and malice respectively. The kind side uses some cotton or feathers to touch the model constantly to bring protection to the model. The malicious side is the knife, which keeps cutting and hurting the model. </p>

                <p>The gestures of the audience are captured through the real-time camera to drive the rotation of the motor. This not only allows the audience to participate in the project and give the audience a certain sense of the impact of what should be done good or bad, but it will end up with an unpredictable model, we don't know what he will look like in the end. </p>

                <h3>Reflection and Future Development</h3>
                <p>I also encountered many difficulties in the process of creating this project. Due to my lack of ability to write code, I can only modify other people's code to achieve the desired result. I am not particularly familiar with the model of gesture recognition, and it needs to be studied in depth. When using the motor, the power of the motor is not enough, sometimes it will stop, and it may be necessary to replace the motor with stronger power
                    Next, I hope to further promote this project, increase the volume of the project, add more gestures, and use more motors to run at the same time. If possible, I hope to add some image expression, present different images through gesture input, and project them on the surface of the model.</p>
